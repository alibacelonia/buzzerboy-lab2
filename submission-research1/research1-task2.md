# Agile Development Plan for Just-In-Time Environment Access (JITEA)

## Introduction
As the senior engineer on the JITEA project, I'm excited to present our Agile development plan. This plan outlines our approach to building a system that provides temporary access to production environments, ensuring efficiency, security, and compliance.

## Epics, Features, and User Stories

### Epic 1: Access Request Management
- **Feature 1.1: Request Form**
  - **User Story 1.1.1**: As a developer, I need to submit an access request form for production environments to quickly obtain the necessary permissions.
  - **User Story 1.1.2**: As a manager, I need to view all pending access requests to efficiently approve or deny them.

- **Feature 1.2: Approval Workflow**
  - **User Story 1.2.1**: As a manager, I need notifications for new access requests to ensure timely reviews and approvals.
  - **User Story 1.2.2**: As a developer, I need notifications when my request is approved or denied to stay informed.

### Epic 2: Automated Provisioning
- **Feature 2.1: Integration with Cloud Services**
  - **User Story 2.1.1**: As a developer, I need automatic provisioning of access upon approval to begin work without delays.
  - **User Story 2.1.2**: As an admin, I need to configure integrations with cloud services like AWS and Azure for seamless access management.

- **Feature 2.2: Time-Limited Access Management**
  - **User Story 2.2.1**: As a developer, I want my access to automatically expire after a set period to maintain security.
  - **User Story 2.2.2**: As a manager, I need the ability to review and extend access when necessary for critical tasks.

### Epic 3: Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration
- **Feature 3.1: Unified Login**
  - **User Story 3.1.1**: As a developer, I want to use SSO to log in to JITEA and access all integrated systems effortlessly.
  - **User Story 3.1.2**: As an admin, I need to configure SSO settings to ensure a smooth and secure login experience.

### Epic 4: Audit and Compliance
- **Feature 4.1: Activity Logs**
  - **User Story 4.1.1**: As an auditor, I need detailed logs of access requests and approvals to support compliance and security audits.
  - **User Story 4.1.2**: As a developer, I want to view my access history to track past access periods.

- **Feature 4.2: Reporting**
  - **User Story 4.2.1**: As a manager, I need reports on access patterns and approval times to analyze and improve processes.
  - **User Story 4.2.2**: As an admin, I need to generate compliance reports for internal and external audits.

### Epic 5: User Interface and Experience
- **Feature 5.1: Request Dashboard**
  - **User Story 5.1.1**: As a developer, I need an intuitive dashboard to track my access requests and their statuses easily.
  - **User Story 5.1.2**: As a manager, I need a streamlined interface to review and manage access requests efficiently.

- **Feature 5.2: Notifications and Alerts**
  - **User Story 5.2.1**: As a developer, I want real-time notifications about my access request status to stay updated.
  - **User Story 5.2.2**: As an admin, I need to manage notification settings for different roles to ensure appropriate communication.

## Development Workflow

1. **Task Assignment**
   - We will use Jira, Azure Boards, or Trello to create and manage tasks based on user stories. Tasks will be assigned based on team membersâ€™ expertise and workload.

2. **Sprint Planning**
   - Tasks will be organized into sprints with clear goals. Sprint planning meetings will help define scope and align with project objectives.

3. **Daily Standups**
   - Daily standups will be held to discuss progress, address blockers, and adjust tasks as needed to keep the project on track.

4. **Code Reviews and Pull Requests**
   - A code review process using pull requests will be implemented to manage code conflicts and ensure high quality. Branching strategies will be employed for feature development and integration.

5. **Testing and QA**
   - Features will be developed incrementally and tested rigorously. Integration testing will ensure that all components function together smoothly.

6. **Deployment and Monitoring**
   - Features will be deployed to a staging environment before production. Ongoing monitoring will be conducted to identify and address any issues.

## Conclusion
This Agile development plan provides a structured approach to building JITEA, ensuring effective collaboration, timely delivery, and high-quality results. I look forward to working with the team to achieve our project goals.
